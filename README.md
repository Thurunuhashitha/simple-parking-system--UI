1. Project Overview
   
Introduction

The ARparking Master project endeavors to revolutionize the parking landscape in Sri Lanka by 
introducing a comprehensive and user-friendly parking management system. The traditional 
challenges associated with finding parking spaces will be mitigated through this innovative system, 
providing drivers with a seamless solution to reserve and manage parking.
Objectives

At its core, ARparking Master aims to offer a convenient platform for drivers to reserve parking 
spaces with ease. By streamlining the payment process and enhancing overall parking management 
efficiency, the system seeks to address the pressing issues associated with urban parking in Sri Lanka. 
This includes reducing congestion, enhancing user experience, and optimizing space utilization.
Key Features

• Online Booking: ARparking Master allows drivers to input location, time, and vehicle details, 
facilitating the reservation of parking spaces effortlessly.

• QR Code Integration: A secure QR code system is seamlessly integrated into the platform, 
ensuring a quick and secure entry and exit process at parking locations.

• Real-time CCTV Access: Users gain the ability to monitor their parked vehicles through 
strategically placed CCTV cameras at each parking location.

• Flexible Payment Options: The system offers a variety of payment options, including on-thespot payments or advanced payments during the online booking process, providing users with financial flexibility.

3. Project Planning

Scope and Deliverables

The project scope encompasses the end-to-end development and implementation of the ARparking 
Master system. Deliverables include a user-friendly mobile application, QR code generation and 
integration, and establishing seamless connectivity with diverse parking facilities across the country.
Timeline

The project timeline is meticulously crafted to outline key milestones, development phases, testing 
periods, and the targeted launch date. The timeline ensures that each phase of the project, from 
system development to beta testing and user feedback incorporation, is executed with precision.
Resource Allocation

To ensure the successful execution of the project, resources such as human capital, technological 
infrastructure, and financial investments are allocated judiciously. This strategic allocation facilitates 
the efficient development and deployment of the ARparking Master system.

6. Risk Management
   
Identification of Risks

In any project of this magnitude, potential risks must be identified to proactively address challenges 
that may arise. Risks may include technological hurdles, user adoption issues, or concerns related to 
the security of user data. A comprehensive risk assessment is conducted to catalog and analyze these 
potential challenges.

Mitigation Strategies

Mitigation strategies are formulated for each identified risk, establishing a proactive approach to 
address challenges at various stages of the project. These strategies may include contingency plans, 
alternate solutions, or collaborative efforts to overcome potential obstacles.

8. Project Monitoring and Control
   
Progress Monitoring

Regular progress reports are generated throughout the project's lifecycle. These reports offer 
detailed insights into the development status, adherence to timelines, and resource utilization. 
Monitoring progress ensures that the project stays on track and that any deviations from the plan are 
promptly addressed.

Quality Control

Stringent quality control measures are implemented to guarantee the reliability, security, and userfriendliness of the ARparking Master system. Rigorous testing, including functionality, security, and usability tests, is conducted to identify and rectify any issues before the official launch.

User Feedback Integration

Continuous feedback from beta testing and user reviews plays a pivotal role in refining and 
enhancing the system. User experience is prioritized, and feedback is actively incorporated to ensure 
that the final product aligns with the needs and expectations of the end-users.

10. Project Closure
    
Evaluation of Objectives

Upon the completion of the ARparking Master system, a comprehensive evaluation is conducted to 
measure the success of the project. Key performance indicators, including user satisfaction, efficient 
parking management, and the effectiveness of the payment processes, are scrutinized to gauge the 
project's impact.

Lessons Learned

An in-depth analysis of the project's successes and challenges yields valuable insights for future 
initiatives. Documenting lessons learned is a critical step in the project closure process, serving as a 
reference point for refining project management strategies and approaches in subsequent projects.
Future Enhancements

The closure of the ARparking Master project marks the beginning of a new phase where 
opportunities for future enhancements are explored. As technology evolves and user needs change, 
the system must adapt. Future enhancements may include additional features, expanded 
geographical coverage, or integration with emerging technologies to ensure the continuous evolution 
and relevance of the ARparking Master system.
